# go-programming-language

This repo contains the code related to the exercises within the [book](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Donovan-Go-Programming-Language-The/PGM234922.html) _The Go Programming Language_ by Alan A.A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan.

The book has its own page [here](https://www.gopl.io/) and an accompanying source code [repo](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io).

## Local packages
Some of these assignments ask for the definition of a package object (or at least
suggest use of one to minimize duplication). Here, we've placed those packages
in `/src/`. You will simply have to update your `GOPATH` as:
```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go:$HOME/<PATH_OF_THIS_REPO>/go-programming-language
```
if you want to use them internal to the chapter exercise directories.
